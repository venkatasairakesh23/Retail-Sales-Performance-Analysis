# Retail-Sales-Performance-Analysis

Overview

This project analyzes retail sales data from a Superstore dataset to identify key business insights, sales trends, and profitability patterns. Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and created visualizations to support data-driven business decisions.

Objectives

1. Clean and preprocess retail sales data.
2. Analyze sales & profit trends over time.
3. Identify top-performing products, categories, and regions.
4. Provide actionable recommendations to improve sales.
