# Retail-Sales-Performance-Analysis

Overview

This project analyzes retail sales data from a Superstore dataset to identify key business insights, sales trends, and profitability patterns. Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and created visualizations to support data-driven business decisions.
